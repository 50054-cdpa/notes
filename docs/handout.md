# 50.054 Compiler Design and Program Analysis Course Handout

## This page will be updated regularly. Sync up often.

## Course Description

This course aims to introduce a new programming paradigm to the learners, Functional programming and the suite of advanced language features and design patterns for software design and development. By building on top of these techniques, the course curates the process of designing a modern compiler, through syntax analysis, intermediate presentation construction, semantic analysis and code generation. More specifically the course focuses on the application of program analysis in areas of program optimization and software security analysis. 


## Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, students are able to

1. Implement software solutions using functional programming language and applying design patterns
1. Define the essential components in a program compilation pipeline
1. Design a compiler for an imperative programming language
1. Optimise the generated machine codes by applying program analysis techniques
1. Detect bugs and security flaws in software by applying program analysis techniques


## Measurable Outcomes

1. Develop a parser for an imperative programming language with assignment, if-else and loop (AKA the source language) using Functional Programming
1. Implement a type checker for the source language
1. Develop a static analyser to eliminate dead codes
1. Implement the register allocation algorithm in the target code generation module
1. Develop a static analyser to identify potential security flaws in the source language

## Project

[Project Template](https://github.com/50054-cdpa/project/)

The aim of the project is to apply the techniques and concepts taught in this module to develop a simple compiler for the SIMP language. 

You may work as a team (up to max 3 members). Please register your team [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q-H2T4bQlWroEMokxy32C8DH2ZzhfthH-dUkC2QWPAo/edit?usp=sharing).  

* Lab 1 (10%, Deadline - 16 Nov 2025 23:59)
* Lab 2 (10%, Deadline - 30 Nov 2025 23:59)
* Lab 3 (15%, Deadline - 14 Dec 2025 23:59)


## Submission Policy and Plagiarism
1. You will do the assignment/project on your own (own teams) and will not copy paste solutions from someone else.
1. You will not post any solutions related to this course to a private/public repository that is accessible by the public/others.
1. Students are allowed to have a private repository for their assignment which no one can access. 
1. For projects, students can only invite their partners as collaborators to a private repository.
1. Failing to follow the Code of Honour will result in failing the course and/or being submitted to the University Disciplinary Committee. The consequences apply to both the person who shares their work and the person who copies the work.


## Make Up and Alternative Assessment
Make ups for Final exam will be administered when there is an official Leave of Absence from OSA. There will be only one make up. There will be no make-up if students miss the make up test.
